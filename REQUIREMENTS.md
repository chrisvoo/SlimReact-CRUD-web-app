# Requirements

You should write a simple HR app. There should be departments with names and employees
with names and salaries. As a minimum it should be possible to add departments and employees, and to run the 
following reports:

1. Show all departments along with the highest salary within each department. A department
   with no employees should show 0 as the highest salary.
2. List just those departments that have more than two employees that earn over 50,000.

Please use PHP & MySQL to implement this. Do not use an ORM or CMS but feel free to use
any other frameworks or libraries as you see fit. You must either host your solution
somewhere or provide instructions for running it.  
Please also give an indication of how much time you spent on the solution.  
Beyond meeting the basic requirements above, you should add something to showcase your
skills & understanding. It could be how you architect the app, test it or the visual
presentation or something else - play to your strengths. You will also be able to discuss
how you could improve your solution further given more time.
